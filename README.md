What happens when you change:

geometric_py:
- constantFactor?
    multiples of the radius of the last circle
- what about circleSize?
    the radius of the circle
- can you grow or shrink the shapes? does it matter?
    yes,changes in the code
- can you relocate the smallest shape?
    yes,changes in the code

colour_py
- change any of the variables in lerpColor()?
    If change width to 100, the width of color on the screen over 100 (x>100), the color value is d.
- change the 1.0 to a 1?
    float is changed to int, so the color value on the screen are only have c and d.
- can you make the gradient flow diagonally?    
    yes,changes in the code
- can you make the gradient stop and start in other ways?
    yes stop when x>width, and color will be random 
    and changes in the code
- insert blank space?
    yes,changes in the code
